# Project Documentation

This directory gathers every document a new contributor needs. Start here, then drill into the topic-specific guides as you ramp up.

| Document | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [architecture.md](architecture.md) | Explains the UI surfaces (Dashboard, Kanban, Scheduling), data model, and Zustand store responsibilities. Useful when deciding where a feature belongs. |
| [development-guide.md](development-guide.md) | Day-to-day workflow: environment setup, coding conventions, feature toggles, and tips for navigating the repo. |
| [testing.md](testing.md) | How to run Vitest and Playwright (including the base URL override) plus guidance on verifying the scheduling legend filters. |
| [deployment.md](deployment.md) | Updated deployment notes for Vercel/Netlify/S3. |
| [archive/](archive/) | Historical context, migration logs, and older plans that are no longer part of the active process. Browse only if you need background information. |

If you add a new guide, link it in this table so the next developer can find it quickly.

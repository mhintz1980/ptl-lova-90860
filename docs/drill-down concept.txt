data drilling
Whether examining reports of sales revenue, production output or administrative expenses, it’s often valuable to examine the underlying data in more detail. That’s what data drilling is all about. It’s a simple analysis technique that businesses can use to explore data and gain insights into the causes of trends. For example, if a national sales report shows unusually rapid revenue growth, a sales leader can drill down into the report to find out which regions or products contributed to the increase. Ultimately, data drilling helps companies make more informed business decisions to increase revenue and improve operational efficiency.

What Is Data Drilling?
Data drilling is a business intelligence (BI) technique that helps companies analyze information by providing different views of the data in reports, charts and spreadsheets. It’s a simple and valuable tactic that can help reveal the cause of trends. Most commonly, data drilling is used to examine the detailed information that lies behind the summary data shown in reports. Often, businesses can drill down to see progressively more detailed views of information that let them pinpoint the precise factors driving trends or anomalies.

Key Takeaways
Data drilling is a simple, fundamental analysis technique that helps to reveal the causes of trends.
It can be applied to analyze data in reports, charts and spreadsheets.
Drill downs are the most common type of data drilling. Drilling down provides more detailed views of the data behind the summary information in reports.
Drill hierarchies determine the pathways companies can use for data drilling.
Data Drilling Explained
The ability to summarize vast amounts of raw data in reports and dashboards is critical for monitoring and improving business performance. But just as critical is the ability to explore the data to gain a better understanding of the trends and factors driving them. Data drilling helps companies do that.

There are several types of data drilling, including drilling down, drilling up and drilling across (also known as drilling through). Drill-down analysis is the most common. As the name suggests, it involves delving into summary information for a more detailed view of the underlying data. For example, a sales leader could drill down into a national sales report for a more detailed view of sales in individual regions and cities, then drill down within each city to examine store-by-store revenues. Companies can also drill up from specific details to more general information for a big-picture view or drill across to other related datasets.

Data-drilling capabilities depend on how the underlying data was originally collected and categorized and how it’s stored — which is often done in a data warehouse. The more fine-grained the original data, the further you’ll be able to drill down to view detailed information.

What’s the Difference Between Drill Downs and Drill-Through Reports?
Drill downs and drill-through reports both provide ways to obtain more information about items in a report. An important aspect of business intelligence, drilling down into data helps you interactively examine more detailed layers of data within a report. For example, you may be able to drill down into a national sales report to find:

What percentage of total sales did the Northeast region generate?
How much of Northeast sales revenue was generated by in-store sales?
Which Northeast stores generated the most revenue?
Drill-through reports are those opened by clicking on an item that then takes a person to another related report. Often, the drill-through report contains more details about an item listed in a summary report. For example, clicking on the name of a specific store opens a report about the store’s performance.

Why Is Data Drilling Important? Why Drill Your Data?
While all business reports can reveal upward or downward trends, data drilling helps businesses perform diagnostic analysis, or the process of understanding why trends and events happen. It enables you to view the data in different ways and explore related information that provides valuable context.

People across a business, whether they’re in sales, marketing, manufacturing or other department, can use data drilling to gain insights into their parts of the business. Data drilling is particularly useful because people generally don’t require any specialized technical knowledge to apply it. Data drilling also provides more flexibility and reduces redundancy by letting multiple managers explore the same dataset in different ways depending on their needs. And it makes analysis more widespread because you don’t have to be an expert in data science to drill down into reports and begin to identify trends.

What Are Drill Hierarchies?
A drill hierarchy defines the paths that people can use for data drilling within a report or spreadsheet. It is a predetermined set of data groupings at multiple levels, with the summary data at the top and progressively more detailed subgroups of data below. Drill hierarchies are often based on geographic regions or units of time. For example, descriptive analysis in a report might show ecommerce sales for the last month. To analyze the data in more detail, you could drill down through the hierarchy to examine sales for specific days, hours within each day and even minutes within each hour.

Benefits of Data Drilling
The main benefit of data drilling is to quickly provide better insights into the information in a report or spreadsheet. Understanding the cause of a trend enables decision-makers to quickly act on the data. For example, a consolidated sales report may show that overall sales are growing — but data drilling reveals that sales of some products are rising rapidly, while sales of other products are actually falling. Based on that analysis, the company can further investigate the causes and decide where to focus its resources.

Furthermore, data drilling delivers different points of view based on the same data. Managers and analysts can explore the data from different perspectives to gain a more thorough understanding of the underlying trends.

Limits of Data Drilling
Data drilling is limited by the way the data was originally entered and categorized, and by the paths defined by the drill hierarchy. Data drilling provides a predetermined number of ways to explore data, such as drilling up and down the hierarchy. A person can only drill down to the lowest level of detail defined in the hierarchy. To explore the data in other ways, businesses need to use other analysis techniques, such as machine learning.

Data quality can also limit the value of data drilling — as with any BI approach, data drilling is only useful if the underlying data is accurate and current.

Drilling Types
There are several types of data drilling, each referring to a different way to navigate through data. Here are the most common.

Drilling down involves navigating down through a hierarchy of information from the most general summary data to more specific data grouped at various sublevels. For example, in a report that lists the latest quarter’s total vehicle sales, a person might drill down to see sales of trucks and then drill down again to see sales of each truck model.

Drilling up is the opposite — moving up the drill hierarchy from a detailed view of a subgroup to a more consolidated view. For example, if a salesperson is currently viewing truck sales data, she could drill up to see total sales of all vehicles.

Drilling in, or drill-to-detail, provides more detail about a specific point on a chart or graph. Clicking on a point in a line graph showing the year’s sales might display the raw data for a specific month.

Drilling across or drilling through: Drilling across, also known as drilling through, links to a related report or other information outside the current report. Often, that report is generated by a different application. For example, if a salesperson is examining information about specific truck models in a sales report, he might then drill across to production data for the same model.

Drilling Use Cases
Every department in an organization can use data drilling to explore their data. Typical use cases involve drilling down to see more detail or the causes of trends.

Geographic analysis: In a general sales report, you can drill down from overall numbers to more specific revenues. A state-by-state report of sales revenues may allow you to select a particular state, click on it and then see sales revenues for each county or city in that state.
Time-based analysis: Alternatively, if the original data is date-based, you may drill through the data by drilling down from annual numbers to figures for each quarter, each month or each day.
Visualizations: Similar drill downs can be applied to visualizations. In a line graph, a person can click on points to uncover the data it represents (a 52-week high price, for example). If regional sales data is represented as a map, the person could click on a region to see the detailed underlying data.
How to Drill Up and Down
Drilling up and down are generally simple and intuitive operations, although the exact method varies depending on the software you’re using. Within reports, icons associated with each item indicate whether a person can drill down for more detail or drill up for an aggregated view. Some products allow users to view the entire drill hierarchy, so they can see all the levels of detail available in drill downs. Links indicate whether they can drill across to related reports.

Data drilling is one of the most fundamental and important business intelligence techniques. It’s simple to use and applicable to almost any kind of business data. By enabling businesses to explore information from different perspectives and at different levels, data drilling can provide fresh insights into trends. Data drilling helps businesses understand not only what is happening, but also why it is happening.

Data Drilling FAQs
How does drill down work?
Users can drill down through a tabular report, worksheet or chart by moving down through a predetermined hierarchy of categories. For example, each line in a company’s sales report may list annual sales for a specific business group. Drilling down into that data may display sales for a specific month, weekly sales or day-to-day sales figures.

What are drill pathways?
Drill pathways, or drill maps, determine the options available for data drilling within a report. Typically, you can drill up or down a hierarchy of data categories using preset pathways — for example, you can drill down from national to regional and local data.

What visuals can be drilled?
A variety of visuals can be drilled, depending on the software you’re using. They typically include bar graphs, pie charts, bubble and leaf diagrams. Hovering over a particular graphic element will usually reveal whether it can be drilled. Drilling a graph typically displays detailed data for the selected element within the graph.

What do you mean by a drill through report?
A drill-through report is one that is also linked to another related report. For example, a report that lists mileage for all vehicle categories may link to a report detailing sales figures for pickup trucks.

Why do we have to drill down the data?
Drilling down through data is a quick way to better understand trends and important details in the data contained within a report. It can help companies understand the elements that are responsible for overall patterns within the data. For example, if the company’s manufacturing output slowed, drilling down may pinpoint the facilities or production lines responsible for the decrease.

What does drill down mean in accounting?
Data drilling is a business intelligence (BI) technique. It can help companies in various industries and any department — including accounting — that has data and reporting can use data drilling. It helps companies analyze information by providing different views of the data in reports, charts and spreadsheets. If a financial report shows a dramatic increase in revenue, you can drill down into the data to see what’s driving the sales. For example, a company that sells reusable products noticed a dramatic increase in revenue one quarter. After drilling down into the details, they found most of the increase was driven by the sale of reusable grocery bags after a law went into effect banning the use of plastic bags in stores.

Introduction to Drill-Through Charts
In the realm of data visualization, Drill-Through charts are invaluable for users seeking to delve deeper into their datasets. These charts enable interactive exploration by allowing users to click on specific data points and reveal detailed information that is otherwise hidden. This functionality is particularly useful for understanding complex data and uncovering trends or insights that are not immediately visible.

Drill-Through charts are designed to provide a more granular view of data. For instance, a high-level sales report might show total sales by region. By using a Drill Through chart, a user can click on a particular region to see a breakdown of sales by individual stores or products within that region. This interaction not only enhances the depth of analysis but also keeps the primary dashboard uncluttered by focusing on specific details only when needed.

The concept of Drill Through charts hinges on data hierarchy and the ability to navigate through different levels of data seamlessly. Typically, these charts are linked to a database or a data warehouse that stores hierarchical data, allowing users to drill down from summary information to more detailed layers. This hierarchical approach helps in maintaining a clear and organized view of data while providing the flexibility to explore specific details as required.


Drill-Down vs. Drill-Through: Understanding the Key Differences
Both drill-down and drill-through functionalities serve as essential methods for exploring data, but they are used in distinct ways and provide different levels of insight. Understanding the difference between these two techniques is crucial for leveraging them effectively in your analysis.

Drill-Down: Zooming In for Deeper Detail
Drill-down allows users to start at a summary level of data and progressively zoom into more detailed levels within the same dataset. It is a hierarchical process, where users click on a high-level view (such as total sales by region) and then drill down to see more specific data points (e.g., sales by city, store, or even individual products). This method is ideal for discovering granular information within a single dataset, as it maintains the same context while presenting more detailed layers.

For example, in a financial dashboard, a drill-down might show a company's overall revenue, and by drilling down, users can see the revenue by product line, and then further into revenue by individual products.


Drill-Through: Moving Across Datasets for Contextual Insights
On the other hand, drill-through is designed to take users from one view or report to another, often crossing over into different datasets or reports. Instead of merely zooming into deeper layers of the same data, drill-through offers a transition to a different dashboard or report altogether, providing additional context or related information.

For instance, a user may start on a sales performance dashboard, click on a specific region, and be redirected (drill-through) to a customer satisfaction report for that region. This method gives a broader perspective and is ideal for exploring related but separate aspects of the data, which can provide a more comprehensive analysis.


Key Differences in Use Cases
Drill-Down is most effective when you need to explore finer details within a single dataset, helping users uncover specific insights by navigating through hierarchical data levels.
Drill-Through is used when you need to link to another report or dataset for a broader, more contextual view, allowing users to investigate a different aspect of the data without losing context.
In summary, both techniques are invaluable for data exploration, but they serve distinct purposes. Drill-down is about zooming deeper into data hierarchies, while drill-through is about transitioning between different datasets or reports for a wider range of insights.


Benefits of Using Drill-Through Charts
Drill-Through charts offer a range of benefits that enhance data analysis and visualization. One of the primary advantages is their ability to provide detailed insights without cluttering the main dashboard.

This interactive approach helps users focus on high-level summaries and dive deeper into areas of interest, facilitating a more targeted and efficient analysis process.

Another significant benefit of Drill-Through charts is their capacity to uncover trends and patterns that might otherwise remain hidden in aggregated data. For instance, a sales performance chart showing total revenue by region can reveal underlying issues or opportunities when users drill down into individual sales transactions or product categories. This capability enables more granular analysis, helping organizations identify specific areas for improvement or growth. Overall, Drill-Through charts empower users to explore data dynamically, leading to more informed decisions and a better understanding of complex datasets.

Best Practices for Creating Drill-Through Charts
Creating effective Drill-Through charts requires careful planning and thoughtful design to ensure they deliver the most valuable insights. Here are some best practices to follow:


1. Define Clear Data Hierarchies
Ensure that your data is structured in a clear hierarchy that makes sense for drill-through functionality. Start with high-level summary data (e.g., total sales, overall performance) and allow users to drill into more specific data points, such as regional sales, product-level performance, or customer segments. Properly defining these levels makes it easier for users to navigate and explore the data.


2. Use Relevant Drill-Through Fields
Choose drill-through fields that add meaningful value to your analysis. The data points you allow users to drill into should provide deeper, actionable insights, rather than just more granular details. For instance, allowing a user to drill down from "Total Sales" to "Sales by Product Category" is useful, while drilling into overly specific or irrelevant details could overwhelm the user.


3. Ensure Seamless User Experience
The drill-through functionality should feel natural and intuitive. Label clickable data points clearly so that users know where they can drill down. Also, make sure the transition from the main chart to the drill-through page is smooth, providing context and maintaining consistency in design and layout. Use breadcrumbs or easy navigation options so users can move back and forth without confusion.


4. Limit the Number of Drill-Through Levels
While Drill-Through charts offer powerful exploration capabilities, too many drill-down levels can overwhelm the user. Stick to 2-3 levels of drill-through data to maintain clarity and focus. Providing too many layers of data could make navigation cumbersome and reduce the overall effectiveness of the chart.


5. Customize and Format Your Drill-Through Charts for Readability
Use consistent formatting and chart types across your drill-through pages. A sudden change in chart type or color scheme can confuse users and make data harder to interpret. Additionally, ensure that your drill-through charts are optimized for readability with clear labels, legends, and tooltips that explain the data.


6. Optimize Performance with Efficient Data Queries
Drill-Through charts rely on real-time data queries, so performance is critical. Optimize your data connections and queries to ensure fast load times as users navigate between data layers. Slow performance can frustrate users and make the drill-through experience less efficient.


7. Test the Drill-Through Experience
Before finalizing the chart, test the entire drill-through flow from the user’s perspective. Make sure the right fields and data levels are being displayed, and that users can easily interpret the insights. Testing ensures that the drill-through experience is both functional and valuable.


8. Provide Contextual Information
As users drill down into more detailed data, include context in the drill-through pages. Use headings, descriptions, or notes to explain the relationship between the high-level summary and the detailed data. Providing context helps users better understand the story behind the data, especially when they move between different data layers.

By following these best practices, you can create Drill-Through charts that are not only interactive but also intuitive, efficient, and insightful, helping users explore data dynamically while maintaining clarity and focus.


Detailed Drill-Down Exploration: Delving into Deeper Data Layers
The real value lies in the ability to drill down into your data, moving beyond surface-level summaries to uncover more granular, hidden insights. The Drill-Down functionality enables users to start their analysis with a high-level view—such as overall sales, regional performance, or customer segments—and progressively zoom into specific details like individual transactions, customer behavior, or product performance.


Dynamic Interaction for Focused Insights
One of the key strengths of Drill-Down exploration is its dynamic interaction with your data. Instead of overwhelming users with too much information upfront, it allows for a structured, step-by-step exploration. For instance, a sales dashboard showing overall performance by region can be drilled into further to reveal individual stores or product categories within that region. This targeted approach makes it easy to identify opportunities or pinpoint areas of concern without sifting through endless amounts of data.

This flexibility is crucial for business leaders and analysts who need to navigate between high-level trends and detailed data points effortlessly. Whether it’s breaking down financial metrics or drilling into customer demographics, Drill-Down functionality empowers users to discover relevant insights quickly and efficiently.


Uncover Hidden Patterns and Anomalies
Drill-Down exploration also plays an essential role in investigating anomalies and unusual patterns. For example, if a dashboard shows an unexpected spike in sales during a specific month, Drill-Down allows you to isolate the exact products, regions, or customer segments contributing to this change. Was there a particular promotion driving this spike, or did external market factors play a role? By zooming into the finer details, you can get answers that guide strategic decisions.

Moreover, when analyzing trends over time, Drill-Down charts help uncover long-term patterns or hidden correlations that could otherwise be missed. Instead of making assumptions based on aggregate data, decision-makers can make more informed choices by fully understanding the underlying factors driving these trends.


Simplified Exploration for Complex Datasets
Drill-Down functionality also brings simplicity to complex datasets. By starting with a clean, high-level view and allowing users to dive deeper only when necessary, dashboards remain uncluttered and easy to navigate. This approach enhances user experience by focusing on the most critical data first, while still providing the flexibility to explore further when needed.

Drill-Down exploration strikes a balance between simplicity and depth, providing users with the power to perform detailed investigations without losing sight of the bigger picture. This structured data exploration helps analysts and decision-makers act swiftly and confidently, driving business growth and optimizing performance based on a clear understanding of the insights.

Custom instructions for future agents: Work on PumpTracker Lite (React+TS, Tailwind, Zustand, Recharts, dnd-kit). Follow core flow PO→Kanban/Scheduling→Dashboard→Close. Respect store filters/sorts, shared ChartProps, config-driven dashboard topics (Financials, Production Mgmt). Scheduling revamp: drag/resize scheduled jobs, enforce capacity/man-hour, locks, rules, auto-level toggle. Keep build green, reuse UI primitives/styles, update docs/tests. Charts must be registry-based with drilldown/reset.

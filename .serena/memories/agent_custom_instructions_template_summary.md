Custom instructions now also available in docs/custom-instructions.md for onboarding. Scope: PumpTracker Lite (React+TS, Tailwind, Zustand, Recharts, dnd-kit), flow PO→Kanban/Scheduling→Dashboard→Close. In-flight dashboard topics (Financials, Production Mgmt) via ChartProps/registry; scheduling revamp (drag/resize scheduled jobs, capacity/man-hour limits, locks, rules, auto-level). Constraints: reuse store/filters/UI primitives, keep build green, avoid ad-hoc state, document/test new behaviors.
